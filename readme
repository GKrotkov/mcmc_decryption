This project decrypts English text scrambled with a 1:1 letter substitution, using Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling via the Metropolis Algorithm, outlined by Chen and Rosenthal in Statistics and Computing edition 22.

This implemention includes multiple optimizations to stabilize the computation of high-exponential likelihoods by applying the log scale and using exponent rules to simplify computations.
